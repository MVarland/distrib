## Instructions/Installation

### Steam
[![Steam Install](misc/images/aqtionsteam.png)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1978800/AQtion)

*It is highly recommended to use the Steam installer, it is free and will update on its own with the most recent content and features.*

---

### Existing Quake II installations
1. Download the aqtion-content zip file and extract the `action` directory into the same directory where `baseq2` exists (in the same directory as your Quake II executable)
1. To start Quake II under the `action` mode, use the following startup parameters: `+set game action`
1. ***Note:*** Config files from your `baseq2` directory will still execute, so there may be some unexpected binds or cvars set
