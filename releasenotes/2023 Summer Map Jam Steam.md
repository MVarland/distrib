## 25th Anniversary Action Quake 2 / AQtion Map Jam

##### Playtesting and Voting Starting Now!

In a minor deviation from the planned testing/voting format, we will be playtesting the new Map Jam maps in pickup games and a few select public servers.  This will allow us to get a better feel for the maps and provide more feedback to the mappers.

The following servers will be running the new maps exclusively for a short time.  Please join us and help us test the maps and provide feedback to the mappers.  We will be voting on the maps after the playtesting period is over.
