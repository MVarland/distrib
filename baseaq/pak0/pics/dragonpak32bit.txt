Foreword:
Finally, after years of no pak releases, I have come to release a new pak.
Some may remember my earlier pak, The Dragonpak, which was accused of cheat sounds, mainly step sounds.
This pak shouldn't contain any such nonsense, but just pure niceness.
The last pak had a red theme, and this has a nice blue one, due to the injustice the .pcx
palette does towards the blue colour, and because it's my favourite colour.

Requirements:
Quake 2
Action Quake
AprQ2 (Or anything that has .png support) (AprQ2 from: http://apprime.0wns.org/q2/)
A good looking ass
That loving fuzzy warm feeling inside you every time you see a dragon

Contents:
NEW .png console, font, icons, numbers and shit! Blue nice refreshing theme.
And well, that's about it. The pak also contains some models, textures and sounds
that either are from my earlier Dragonpak or some other paks, ie. ripped off,
simply because I liked them and because I was too lazy/couldn't find better ones
anywhere. I'm also truly horrible at skinning, so I decided to give new skins a miss.
NOTE: The .pak file contains an autoexec.cfg which loads up some AprQ2 related
settings which are needed in order to make Dragonpak 32-Bit work as intended,
after which the config loads an autoexec.cfg from your quake2/action directory.
Don't be surprised if you suddenly have an extra clock, fps-meter or a map round
timer. If you aren't satisfied, you can of course change the config to your tastes.

Own opinion:
I like how the pak turned out. I love blue. The only thing I don't like are the
numbers. They turned out a bit girly and faggotry, but that's no problem because
gayness is the way to go!
I'm also a bit disappointed because I was too lazy to make a new menu interface,
but on the other hand, it wouldn't have turned into anything fancy. If you check
out the quit menu, you can see that I ran out of ideas.

Finally:
You are allowed to rip the contents of this pak, and you prolly would even if this
wasn't said here. If you release something that contains anything from this pak, give credit. 
IF this pak contains something that is made by You, and You want me to remove it
from the pak and/or it violates some of Your country laws and/or/if/when/where
it causes you to orgasm, don't hesitate contact me at, well, I'll let this little
fellow tell you.
