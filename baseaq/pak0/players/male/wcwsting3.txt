"When a man's heart is full of deceit, it burns up...dies...and a dark shadow 
falls over his soul. From the ashes of a once great man, has risen a curse, a
wrong that must be righted. We look to the skies for a vindicator, someone to
strike fear into the black hearts of the same men who created him. The battle
between good and evil has begun. Against an army of shadows comes a dark 
warrior, the purveyor of good, with a voice of silence, and a mission of 
justice. This is Sting." -WCW Clash Of The Champions, 8/21/97
