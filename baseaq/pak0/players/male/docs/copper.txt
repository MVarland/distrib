Important:            This skin is free to use by anyone in any game. 
                      I made this skin with the intent on using it for Action Quake 2 [Ie. http://action.telefragged.com/] 
                      But it can be used wherever the model is used.

Thanks:               To the guy who made the original Cop skin [Whoever you might be...] And to the Action Quake 2 team.
