Files:		morpheus.pcx, morpheus_i.pcx, morpheus.txt

Whadda I do???	Unzip all the files into your Quake2/action/players/ActionMale directory 
		(or you can even use the regular Quake2 Supermale model, so I hear)

Notes:		Well, the gloves and bottom of the shoes are just recolored from the
		original skins, so thanks to the original skinners whoever you are.  
		Soon to come, a Dojo Morpheus.  Should look better than this one.

Other crap:	This skin is free and for everyones use, so please dont go 
		out and try to sell it on the street to buy crack.  Modify it 
		if you want, just dont make it look any worse than it already does,
		and let me know about it.  Include it in any webpace, skinpack, or
		CD compilation you want, just include this textfile with it.  And
		again, it would be nice of you to let me know about it too.


P.S.		Anyone know any secrets of making cool leather jackets?  This was my 
		effort, with mixed results I must say.
