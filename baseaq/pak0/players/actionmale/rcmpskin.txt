RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police [mounties] Actionmale model skin

This is a skin designed for the action quake action male model. 
when i made it i had team play in mind.

A few problems are i couldnt draw the black epilets on his shoulders (spelt wrong)
they kept looking wrong so i didnt bother. Its not PERFECTLY accurate to the rcmp
uniform but i think i did a more then half assed job considering my limited skill
and the model i have to work with.
