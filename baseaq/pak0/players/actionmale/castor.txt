Well, this is my first attempt at a skin of any kind. I was looking at all the action star skins included in action quake and saw most of my favorites but there was nothing to do with "FACE/OFF" - which is one of my all-time favorite movies - so i decided to make the Castor Troy skin available for all quakers to use.
